## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Diana Nicutari**, a data‑driven professional with a background in **biology and bioinformatics**, passionate about using data to extract, interpret, and communicate meaningful insights.

I hold a **Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Bioinformatics** from the **University of Birmingham (UK)**, where my dissertation focused on **optimizing ATAC‑seq workflows for chromatin accessibility analysis** — a project that showcases my interest in data reproducibility and standardization.

With 5 years in **academic publishing for AI and Big Data research**, I’ve honed both analytical and communication skills as a Journal Specialist. I now aim to apply this interdisciplinary experience toward a **data‑focused career** bridging technical analysis and stakeholder communication.
