## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Diana Nicutari**, a **junior data analyst** with a background in **biology and bioinformatics**, passionate about using data to extract, interpret, and communicate meaningful insights.

I hold a **Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Bioinformatics** from the **University of Birmingham (UK)**, where my dissertation focused on **optimizing ATAC‑seq workflows for chromatin accessibility analysis**.

With 6 years in **academic publishing for AI and Big Data research**, I’ve honed both analytical and communication skills as a Journal Specialist, supporting peer-reviewed research workflows and developing strong skills in **data quality, evidence interpretation, and stakeholder communication**. I am now applying this interdisciplinary experience toward a **data‑focused career** bridging technical analysis, scientific literacy and stakeholder communication.
